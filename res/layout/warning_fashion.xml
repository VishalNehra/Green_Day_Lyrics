In his 'vintage suit' and tie\n
He's casualty dressed to the teeth\n
In the latest genocide\n
The new seasons come and go\n
At the dog and pony show\n
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names\n
And fallow your dress codes\n
WHAT'S IN A NAME?...HEY!\n
\n
She's a scented magazine\n
Looking sharp and living clean\n
Living well and dressed to kill\n
But she looks like hell to me\n
\n
So when you're dancing through your wardrobe\n
Do the anorex - a go-go\n
Cloaked with style\n
For pedophiles as the credit card explodes\n
\n
You auctioned off your life\n
For the 'most' expensive price\n
Going once...\n
Going twice...\n
Now it's gone\n
\n
(You the Crew)\n
\n
You auctioned off your life\n
For the 'most' expensive price\n
Going once...\n
Going twice...\n
Now it's gone\n

What's in a name, hey?\n

What's in a name?"/>
