It's been so long\n

And what went wrong\n

I knew you back when\n
And you ... you knew me\n
And now I think I'm sick \n
and I wanna go home\n

Anybody ever say no?\n
Ever tell you that you weren't right?\n
Where did all the little kid go?\n
Did you lose it in a hateful fight?\n
And you know it's true\n

I was just like you\n
