I'm catching train, I'm crashing a car\n
Back in for daylight shooting for the stars\n

Like a lifelong daisy chain\n
Of my imagination\n
A rat inside a maze\n
I got no destination\n

Cause I'm a little boy named Train\n
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same\n
Little boy named Train\n
\n
Don't know where I come from\n
But I know where I have been\n

Serious people are funny to me\n
Funny people seem so serious\n
\n
I'm always lost and nothing will change\n
Give me directions and I'll get lost again\n
