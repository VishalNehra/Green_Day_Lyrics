Hear the sound of the falling rain\n
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)\n
The shame\n
The ones who died without a name\n
\n
Hear the dogs howling out of key\n
To a hymn called 'Faith and Misery' (Hey!)\n
And bleed, the company lost the war today\n
\n
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\n
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives\n
On holiday\n
\n
Hear the drum pounding out of time\n
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)\n
To find, the money's on the other side\n
\n
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)\n
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)\n
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument\n
\n
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\n
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives\n
On holiday\n
\n
(Hey!)\n
\n
(3,4)\n\n
'The representative from California has the floor'\n
\n
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman\n
Bombs away is your punishment\n
Pulverize the Eiffel towers\n
Who criticize your government\n
Bang bang goes the broken glass and\n
Kill all the fags that don't agree\n
Trials by fire, setting fire\n
Is not a way that's meant for me\n
Just cause (hey, hey, hey), \njust cause, because we're outlaws yeah!\n
\n
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\n
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives\n
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\n
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives\n
\n
This is our lives on holiday..."/>
