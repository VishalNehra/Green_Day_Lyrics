But the words would come out wrong\n
Oh if you only knew\n
The way I felt for so long\n
I know that we're worlds apart\n
But I just don't seem to care\n
These feelings in my heart\n
Only with you I want to share\n
\n
The first time I caught a glimpse of you\n
Then my thoughts were only of you\n
\n
I hope that when time goes by\n
You will think the same about me\n
Many nights awake I lie\n
I only wish that you could see\n
I know that we're only friends\n
I hope this feeling never ends\n
If I could only hold you\n
It's the only thing I want to do.\n
\n
The first time I caught \n
A glimpse of you\n
Then my thoughts were only of you"/>
