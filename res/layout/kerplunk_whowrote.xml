I need to tell you\n
It's news that I for thought\n
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?\n
I think that I just forgot\n
\n
Well it hasn't been the first time\n
And it sure does drive me mad\n
\n
There's a boy who fogs his world \n
And now he's getting lazy\n
There's no motivation and frustration \n
makes him crazy\n
He makes a plan to take a stand \n
But always ends up sitting.\n
Someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting\n
\n
I shuffle through my mind\n
To see if I can find\n
The words I left behind\n
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?\n
Oh well...\n
Never mind.\n
\n
Well it hasn't been the first time\n
And it sure does drive me mad\n
\n
There's a boy who fogs his world \n
And now he's getting lazy\n
There's no motivation and frustration \n
makes him crazy\n
He makes a plan to take a stand \n
But always ends up sitting.\n
