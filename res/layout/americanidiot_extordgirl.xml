In an ordinary world\n
And she cant seem to get away\n
\n
He lacks the courage in his mind\n
Like a child left behind\n
Like a pet left in the rain\n
\n
She's all alone again\n
Wiping the tears from her eyes\n
Some days he feels like dying\n
She gets so sick of crying\n
\n
She sees the mirror of herself\n
An image she wants to sell\n
To anyone willing to buy\n
\n
He steals the image in her kiss\n
From her hearts apocalypse\n
From the one called whatsername\n
\n
She's all alone again\n
Wiping the tears from her eyes\n
Some days he feels like dying\n
She gets so sick of crying\n
\n
She's all alone again\n
Wiping the tears from her eyes\n
Some days he feels like dying\n
Some days it's not worth trying\n
Now that they both are finding\n
She gets so sick of crying\n
\n
She's an Extraordinary girl\n

an Extraordinary girl\n
