Blasting out in stereo?\n
Cater to the class and the paranoid,\n
Music to my nervous system\n
Advertising love and religion,
Murder on the airwaves\n
Slogans on the brink of corruption\n
\n
Visions of blasphemy,war and peace\n
Screaming at you\n
\n
I can't see a thing in the video\n
I can't hear a sound on the radio\n
in stereo in the static age\n
\n
Billboard on the rise in the dawn's landscape, \n
Working your insanity\n
Tragic ala madness and concrete Coca Cola execution\n
Conscions on a cross and your hearts in a vice,\n
Squeezing out your state of mind\n
Are what you own that you cannot buy\n
\n
What a fucking tragedy,strategy\n
Screaming at you\n
\n
I can't see a thing in the video\n
I can't hear a sound on the radio\n
in stereo in the static age\n
\n
Hey, hey it's the static age\n
This is how the west was won\n
Hey, hey it's the static age millennium\n
\n
All I want to know is a god damned thing\n
Not what's in the medicine\n
All I want to do is I want to breathe, \n
batteries are not included
What's the latest way that a man can die?\n
Screaming hallelujah?\n
Singing out 'the dawn's early light'\n
\n
The silence of the rotten,forgotten\n
Screaming at you\n
\n
I can't see a thing in the video\n
I can't hear a sound on the radio\n
in stereo in the static age"/>
