Skyscrapers \nand stargazers in my head\n
Are we we are, \nare we we are the waiting, unknown\n 
This dirty town is burning down in my dreams\n
Lost and found city bound in my dreams\n
\n
And screaming, \n
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting\n
And screaming,\n
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting\n
\n
Forget me nots \nand second thoughts live in isolation\n
Heads or tails, fairytales in my mind\n
Are we we are, \nare we we are the waiting unknown\n
Rage and love, the story of my life\n
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie \n
\n
And screaming, \n
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting\n
And screaming,\n
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown\n
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting\n
And screaming,\n
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown\n
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown"/>
