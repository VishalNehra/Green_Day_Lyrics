Why are you crying?\n
Inside your restless soul \n
Your heart is dying?\n
Little one, little one, \n
Your soul is purging\n
Of love and razor blades \n
your blood is surging\n
\n
Runaway\n
From the river to the street \n
And find yourself with your face in the gutter\n
You\'re a stray for the salvation army\n
There is no place like home \n
When you got no place to go\n

Little girl, little girl, \n
Your life is calling\n
The charlatans and saints of your abandon\n
Little one, little one, \n
The sky is falling\n
Your lifeboat of deception is now sailing\n
In the wake all the way no rhyme or reason\n
Your bloodshot eyes \n
Will show your heart of treason\n
\n
Little girl, little girl, you\'re dirty liar\n
You\'re just a junkie preaching to the choir\n

Runaway\n
From the river to the street \n
And find yourself with your face in the gutter\n
You\'re a stray for the salvation army\n
There is no place like home \n
when you got no place to go\n
\n
The traces of blood always follow you home \n
Like the mascara tears from your getaway\n
You\'re walking with blisters and running with shears\n
So unholy sister of grace!\n

Are you standing close to the edge?\n
Lookout to the setting sun\n
The brink of your vision\n
Eternal youth is a landscape of the lie\n

The cracks of my skin can prove\n
As the years will testify\n
Say your prayers and light a fire \n
We\'re going to start a war\n
Your slogan\'s a gun for hire\n

This is why we were on the edge\n
The fight of our lives been drawn to this undying love\n

Falling through broken glass \n
That\'s slashing through your spirit\n
I can hear it like a jilted crowd\n

Gloria!Where are you Gloria?\n
You found a home in \n
All your scars and ammunition\n
You made your bed in salad days \n
Amongst the ruins\n
Ashes to ashes of our youth\n

She smashed her knuckles into winter \n

As autumns wind fades into black\n
She is the saint of all the sinners \n

The one that\'s fallen through the cracks\n
So don\'t put away your burning light\n

Don\'t lose you faith to your lost naivete\n
Weather the storm and don\'t look back on last November\n
When your banners were burning down\n

Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted\n
Bring us the season that we always will remember\n
Don\'t let the bonfires go out\n

    <!-- 21st Century Breakdown -->
    <string name="tcb">
        \nBorn into Nixon I was raised in hell\n
A welfare child\n
Where the teamsters dwelled\n
The last one born\n
And The first one to run\n
My town was blind from refinery sun\n
\n
[Pre-chorus:]\n
My generation is zero\n
I never made it as a working class hero\n
\n
[Chorus:]\n
21st Century Breakdown\n
I once was lost but never was found\n
I think I\'m losing what\'s left of my mind\n
To the 20th century deadline\n
\n
I was made of poison and blood\n
Condemnation is what I understood\n
Video games of the towers fall\n
Homeland security could kill us all\n
\n
[Pre-chorus]\n
[Chorus]\n
\n
We are the class of the class of \'13\n
Born in the era of humility\n
We are the desperate in the decline\n
Raised by the bastards of 1969\n
\n
My name is no one\n
The long lost son\n
Born on the 4th of July\n
Raised in the era of heroes and cons\n
That left me for dead or alive\n
\n
I am a nation\n
A worker of pride\n
My debt to the status quo\n
\n
The scars on my hands\n
And the means to an end\n
Is all the that I have to show\n
\n
I swallowed my pride\n
And I choked on my faith\n
I\'ve given my heart and my soul\n
I\'ve broken my fingers\n
And lied through my teeth\n
The pillar of damage control\n
\n
I\'ve been to the edge\n
And I\'ve thrown the bouquet\n
Of flowers left over the grave\n
I sat in the waiting room\n
Wasting my time\n
And waiting for Judgement Day\n
\n
I praise liberty\n
The \'freedom to obey\'\n
It\'s the song that strangles me\n
Well, don\'t cross the line\n
\n
Oh, dream, America, dream\n
I can\'t even sleep\n
From the light\'s early dawn\n
\n
Oh, scream, America, scream\n
Believe what you see\n
From heroes and cons

Elevated to the point of static\n
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics\n
And the neighborhood\'s a loaded gun\n
Idle thought lead to full-throttle screaming\n
And the welfare is asphyxiating\n
Mass confusion is all the new age \n
And it\'s creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of hysteria\n
\n
Hysteria, mass hysteria!\n
Mass hysteria!\n
Mass hysteria!\n
Mass hysteria!\n
\n
True sounds of maniacal laughter\n
And the deafmute is misleading the choir\n
The punchline is a natural disaster\n
And it\'s sung by the unemployed\n
Fight fire with a riot\n
The class war is hanging on a wire \n
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar\n
When he said \'it\'s just a bunch of niggers \n
Throwing gas into the ....\'\n
\n
Hysteria, mass hysteria!\n
Mass hysteria!\n
Mass hysteria!\n
Mass hysteria!\n
\n
There\'s a disturbance on the oceanside\n
They tapped into the reserve\n
The static response is so unclear now\n
Mayday this is not a test!\n
As the neighborhood burns, America is falling\n
Vigilantes warning ya,\n
calling christian and gloria\n

[B. Modern World]\n
\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
\n
I\'m the class of \'13\n
In the era of dissent\n
A hostage of the soul\n
On a strike to pay the rent\n
The last of the rebels\n
Without a common ground\n
I\'m gonna light a fire into the underground\n
\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
\n
I am a nation without bureaucratic ties\n
Deny the allegation as it\'s written (fucking lies!)\n
\n
I want to take a ride to the great divide\n
Beyond the \'up to date\' and the neo-gentrified\n
The high definition for the low resident\n
Where the value of your mind is not held in contempt\n
I can hear the sound of a beating heart\n
That bleeds beyond a system that\'s falling apart\n
With money to burn on a minimum wage\n
I don\'t give a shit about the modern age\n
\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world!\n
\n
I don\'t wanna live in the modern world! \n
(Mass hysteria!)
