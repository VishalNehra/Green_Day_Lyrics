        \nThere\'s trouble in the air\n
A rumble in the streets\n
A goin\' out business sale\n
In a race to bankruptcy\n
\n
It\'s not 1 to 99\n
It\'s 99 to 1\n
A common cause and a call to arms\n
For the health of our daughters and our sons\n
\n
It\'s 99 revolutions tonight\n
\n
There\'s a rat in the company\n
A bail out on Easy Street\n
How the fuck did the working stiff\n
Become so obsolete?\n
\n
Hit the lights and bang the drum\n
And let your flag unfold\n
\'Cause history will prove itself\n
In the halls of justice and lost souls\n
\n
It\'s 99 revolutions tonight\n
\n
We live in troubled times\n
From the ghetto to an empty suburban home\n
We live in troubled times\n
And I\'m 99% sure that something\'s wrong\n
It\'s all wrong\n
\n
It\'s 99 revolutions tonight\n
\n
9, 9 to 1\n
To one
