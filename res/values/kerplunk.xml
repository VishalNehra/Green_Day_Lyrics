        \nNow it seems I can\'t keep my mind of you\n
My brain drifts back to \n
better days we\'ve been through\n
Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds\n
The love I witched about I finally found\n
\n
But now it\'s gone and I take the blame\n
So there\'s nothing I can do but take the pain\n
Why?\n
\n
Now I dwell on what you remind me of\n
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love\n
As for me... I am blind without a cause\n
And now I reazlied what I have lost\n
\n
It was something real that I could have had\n
Now I play the fool whose stable soul\'s gone bad\n
Why?\n
\n
Tell me the words I might have said\n
That\'s pumping pressure deep inside my head\n
Was it bad enough to be too late?\n
Just tell me the words I might have ate\n
\n
But now it\'s gone and I take the blame\n
So there\'s nothing I can do but take the pain\n
Why?
