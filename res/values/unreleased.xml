        \nLadies and Gentleman, the Mayor of New York.\n
 \n
Good morning. It\'s been brought to my attention that many rap artist claim that they run New York, but this is not the case.\n
In fact, I wrote my own song about what it\'s really like.\n
Please excuse the profanity in advance.\n
 \n
Hit it.\n
 \n
ALRIGHT, NEW YORK!\n
 \n
New York, big city of dreams, \n
and you know that I run this town. (I RUN IT!)\n
The king of the streets, dressed in concrete, \n
skyscrapers on my crown! (I\'m THE KING!)\n
So if you want this Big Apple, \n
come try to take a bite! (C\'MON!)\n
\'Cause I run this motherfucking city and \n
I won\'t give it up without a fight!\n
 \n
Yo, I run New York!\n
It\'s a pain in the ass!\n
The city\'s crowded as fuck,\n
And it\'s covered in trash!\n
 \n
And the sanitation chief just shoved his shit in my face;\n
Another transit strike? Aw, fucking great!\n
 \n
I can\'t wait\n
To have another meeting with the labor union\n
So the mob can bend me over\n
And then shove their fucking shoe in.\n
 \n
So I do it\n
So you can sip your pumpkin latté.\n
I literally run New York and it\'s exhausting!\n
 \n
[Hook: Billie Joe Armstrong:]\n
I run New York\n
It\'s a fucking headache\n
It really wears you down! (IT SUCKS!)\n
 \n
In this lake of bureaucratic bullshit,\n
It\'s a miracle I don\'t drown!\n
 \n
I (double) literally run New York:\n
I run the marathon.\n
Plus I organized it,\n
So I double-run the marathon!\n
 \n
But no one seems to give a fuck that I\'m a paragon.\n
Instead they photoshop me so\n
It\'s looking like I wear a thong,\n
And laugh at it in my own office when I\'m gone.\n
 \n
I went to the Knicks game, and\n
They booed me on the jumbotron!\n
 \n
Excuse me\n
For trying to help you;\n
They won\'t be satisfied until I\'m\n
Locked up in Bellevue.\n
 \n
I guess they don\'t tell you\n
This job sucks dick.\n
I run New York and it feels like SHIT!\n
 \n
The Chief of Police is a major bully,\n
He laughs at my ideas. (HE\'S A JERK!)\n
 \n
He made fun of my tie last week\n
And I had to fight back tears!\n
 \n
Now on the surface, it probably seems like I should quit\n
Cause I spend every day getting punched in the dick.\n
 \n
But at night\n
I travel down into the subway,\n
Wearing chainmail, locked and loaded for gunplay,\n
 \n
And battle the gigantic fire-breathing mutant rats!\n
If I fucking quit, who the fuck would do that?!\n
 \n
I\'ll give you a hint:\n
The answer is no one.\n
That\'s why I\'m in the sewer dressed up like a shogun.\n
Because on the equinox, a Hell Gate springs,\n
Releasing hounds wreathed in the blood of kings.\n
 \n
And no one even knows!\n
They just think I\'m a dork.\n
But I still kill those fucking dogs, because\n
I RUN NEW YORK!\n
 \n
I run New York, it\'s a shitty gig;\n
There\'s no overtime in my pay. (BULLSHIT!)\n
I asked this city for a fucking bonus,\n
And they said "no fucking way!" (UNREAL!)\n
 \n
So rotten is this Big Apple,\n
It\'s crawling with worms inside! (COME ON!)\n
But I run this motherfucking shithole city,\n
And it makes me wanna die!\n
 \n
I RUN NEW YORK!\n
 \n
Thank you.\n

Really good LSD\n
\n
I\'d like to start a band with\n
I\'ll sing and you can\n
Learn to play the tambourine\n
\n
Here\'s an invitation\n
No time for hesitation\n
Come and join my family\n
\n
[Chorus]\n
I live inside of you\n
But you don\'t belong to me\n
I\'m a reflection of you\n
What\'s my recipe?\n
\n
Half a cup satanical\n
Teaspoon puritanical\n
Stir it with a bloody hand\n
Quarter cup messiahcal\n
Sprinkle of maniacle\n
Now I\'m a mechanical man\n
\n
I\'ll give you the heads up\n
Come on and get your legs up\n
This is called the family jam\n
\n
Together we\'ll stay hidden\n
Wait for Armageddon\n
Stick it to the man\n
\n
[Chorus]\n
\n
[Charlie (laughs):] \n
\'Watch this shit, woman! Gonna learn somethin\' right now.\'\n
\n
[Singing]\n
Open up the curtains\n
Then we\'ll start hurting\n
Come on lets do the creepy crawl\n
The shows about to go down\n
Come I got the low down\n
Together we\'ll make Hollywood fall\n
\n
I live inside of you\n
But you don\'t belong to me\n
I\'m a reflection of you\n
What\'s my recipe?\n
\n
I live inside of you\n
But you don\'t belong to me\n
I\'m a reflection of you\n
What\'s my recipe?\n
\n
I live inside of you\n
But you don\'t belong to me\n
I\'m a reflection of you\n
You look at me and what do you see?\n
A half a cup satanical, \n
A teaspoon puritanical,\n
Stirred with a bloody hand\n
A quarter cup messiahcal, \n
A sprinkle of maniacal\n
And now I\'m a mechanical man\n
A half a cup satanical, \n
A teaspoon puritanical,\n
Stirred with a bloody hand\n
A quarter cup messiahcal, \n
A sprinkle of maniacal\n
And now I\'m a mechanical man

    <!-- Like a stone -->
    <string name="likeastone">
        \nOnce upon a time you dressed so fine\n
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn\'t you? \n
Peopled call, say, beware doll, youre bound to fall\n
You thought they were all kiddin you\n
You used to laugh about\n
Everybody that was hangin out\n
Now you don\'t talk so loud\n
Now you don\'t seem so proud\n
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.\n
\n
How does it feel\n
How does it feel\n
To be without a home\n
Like a complete unknown\n
Like a rolling stone?\n
\n
You\'ve gone to the finest school all right, \n
miss lonely\n
But you know you only used to get juiced in it\n
And nobody has ever taught \n
You how to live on the street\n
And now you find out \n
You\'re gonna have to get used to it\n
You said you\'d never compromise\n
With the mystery tramp, \n
But now you realize\n
He\'s not selling any alibis\n
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes\n
And ask him do you want to make a deal?\n
\n
How does it feel\n
How does it feel\n
To be on your own\n
With no direction home\n
Like a complete unknown\n
Like a rolling stone?\n
\n
You never turned around to see the frowns \n
on the jugglers and the clowns\n
When they all come down and did tricks for you\n
You never understood that it ain\'t no good\n
You shouldn\'t let other people get your kicks for you\n
You used to ride on the \n
chrome horse with your diplomat\n
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat\n
Ain\'t it hard when you discover that\n
He really wasn\'t where its at\n
After he took from you \n
everything he could steal.\n
\n
How does it feel\n
How does it feel\n
To be on your own\n
With no direction home\n
Like a complete unknown\n
Like a rolling stone?\n
\n
Princess on the steeple and \n
All the pretty people\n
They\'re drinkin, \n
thinkin that they got it made\n
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things\n
But you\'d better lift your diamond ring, \n
you\'d better pawn it babe\n
You used to be so amused\n
At napoleon in rags and the language that he used\n
Go to him now, he calls you, \n
you cant refuse\n
When you got nothing, \n
you got nothing to lose\n
You\'re invisible now, \n
you got no secrets to conceal.\n
\n
How does it feel\n
How does it feel\n
To be on your own\n
With no direction home\n
Like a complete unknown\n
Like a rolling stone?

        \nLove conquers every time \n
When two hearts come to collide\n
You\'re the card in my valentine \n
And the candy hearts in my mind\n
\n
And true love is the rule\n
And you\'re nobody\'s fool\n
\n
The ship\'s coming to the light\n
And it was love at first sight\n
Baby, babe, you\'re the light \n
And the flame burns in my mind\'s eye\n
\n
When triumph bleeds into bliss \n
And I knew it from the first kiss\n
\n
Tonight, hearts collide\n
Hearts collide\n

When triumph bleeds into bliss\n
And I knew it from the first kiss\n

Tonight, hearts collide\n

Under the valley of the stars\n
There\'s a car crashing\n
