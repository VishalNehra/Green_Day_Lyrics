For blood, sex and booze you give me\n

Some say I\'m disturbed\n
But it\'s what I deserve, another lesson\n
To be learned...from a girl called kill\n
My head is in the gutter\n
Thank you sir, strike up another mandolin\n
Of discipline\n
Throw me to the dogs\n
Let them eat my flesh down\n
To the wood\n
It feels so good
