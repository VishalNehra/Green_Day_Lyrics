Big plans and leaving friends and\n

No time and no copping out\n
She\'s burning daylight and petrol\n
Blacked out the rearview mirror\n
Heading westward on\n
Strung out\n
On confusion road\n
And ten minute nervous breakdowns\n
Xanex a beer for thought\n
And she determined...\n

Is it salvation?\n
Or an escape from discontent?\n
Will she find her name\n
In the California cement?\n
Punched out of the grind\n
That punched her one too many times...\n
Is tragedy 2000 miles away?\n
