Dried up and bulging out my skull\n
My mouth is dry\n
My face is numb\n
Fucked up and spun out in my room\n
\n
On my own... here we go

        \nDo you have the time\n
To listen to me whine\n
About nothing and everything\n
All at once\n
I am one of those\n
Melodramatic fools\n
Neurotic to the bone\n
No doubt about it\n
\n
Sometimes I give myself the creeps\n
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me\n
It all keeps adding up\n
I think I\'m cracking up\n
Am I just paranoid?\n
Am I just stoned?\n
\n
I went to a shrink\n
To analyze my dreams\n
She says it\'s lack of sex\n
That\'s bringing me down\n
I went to a whore\n
He said my life\'s a bore\n
So quit my whining cause\n
It\'s bringing her down\n
\n
Sometimes I give myself the creeps\n
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me\n
It all keeps adding up\n
I think I\'m cracking up\n
Am I just paranoid?\n
Uh, yuh, yuh, ya\n
\n
Grasping to control\n
So I better hold on\n
\n
Sometimes I give myself the creeps\n
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me\n
It all keeps adding up\n
I think I\'m cracking up\n
Am I just paranoid?\n
Am I just stoned?
