        \nI heard you crying loud,\n
all the way across town\n
You\'ve been searching for that someone,\n
and it\'s me out on the prowl\n
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself\n
Well, don\'t get lonely now\n
And dry your whining eyes\n
I\'m just roaming for the moment\n
Sleazin\' my back yard \n
so don\'t get so uptight\n
you been thinking about ditching me\n
\n
No time to search the world around\n
Cause you know where I\'ll be found\n
When I come around\n
\n
I heard it all before\n
So don\'t knock down my door\n
I\'m a loser and a user so \n
I don\'t need no accuser\n
to try and flag me down \n
Because I know you\'re right\n
So go do what you like\n
Make sure you do it wise\n
You may find out that \n
Your self-doubt means nothing\n
was ever there\n
\n
You can\'t go forcing something \n
if it\'s just not right\n

No time to search the world around\n

        \nDear mother,\n
Can you hear me whining?\n
It\'s been three whole weeks\n
Since that I have left your home\n
This sudden fear has left me trembling\n
Cause now it seems that \n
I am out here on my own\n
And I\'m feeling so alone\n

Pay attention to the cracked streets\n
And the broken homes\n
Some call it the slums\n
Some call it nice\n
I want to take you through\n
a wasteland I like to call my home\n
Welcome To Paradise\n
\n
A gunshot rings out at the station\n
Another urchin snaps \n
And left dead on his own\n
It makes me wonder why I\'m still here\n
For some strange reason it\'s now\n
Feeling like my home\n
And I\'m never gonna go\n
\n
Pay attention to the cracked streets\n

Can you hear me laughing\n
It\'s been six whole months\n
